# Xfil

This repository contains my personal exfiltration tools and scripts. It is intended as a collection of practical, self-contained utilities for data exfiltration and related tasks.

## Structure

- `python/simple-https/`: Example Python-based HTTPS file server that generates its own self-signed certificate and listens on your main network interface. Useful for quick, encrypted file transfers or exfiltration scenarios.

Other tools and languages may be added in the future as needed.
